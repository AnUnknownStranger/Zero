Project Part 3: Toggle Dark Mode Feature
This new feature allows an authenticated user to toggle the background of the blog page to either a light or dark background. This has not been a part of any homework or project objective or a subset of any requirement thus far.

Testing Procedure:
Run docker compose up
Go to localhost:8080
Register a new Account and Log in.
After verifying that the log in process works, make sure the signed in user is on the blog page.
Click on the Toggle Mode Button to either light or dark background.
If the background has changed colors, then the toggle mode button works and the feature works as described.
